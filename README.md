## Overview

Run npm start to run the web UI and log in via both your apple music and spotify account. Indicate which platform you are exporting from and which platform you want to import to, select the playlists you want to migrate, and look at the progress on the web app. If any song transfers fail because of availability or mismatch in records between platforms our app will indicate that.
